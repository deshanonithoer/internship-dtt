# Internship-dtt
This is my github repository for the intership at DTT Multimedia.
The assignment was very educational. I do not have a lot of experience with REST APIâ€™s so it was a lot of researching. I hope that the requirements are met and the assignment lives up to expectation. 

# Installation
To install the application, first clone the repository. After cloning, execute `composer install` in the terminal inside the application directory. Inside the repository, there resides a SQL dump file. You can execute this file in your database to install the database with the required tables. There is also another file called DTT.postman_collection.json. You can import this file into postman to view the API documentation. After installing with composer you can set the repository directory to your local server (mamp, xampp, etc.).
